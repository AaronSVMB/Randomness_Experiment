# Randomness Experiment

This contains an implementation for our 'high variance' experiment that is slated to run in Fall 2023 at George Mason Universty. This repository contains eight experimental environments and those projects are described in detail below. For more information on the design of the experiment, contact aaberman@chapman.edu.

More adptly named additive variance // shocks experiment. This project is motivated by the findings of Hajikhemeneh and Iannaccone (2022) in which they found cooperation to be bolstered in the standard formulation of the linear-VCM, public goods game, in the presence of a higher variance environment. This high variance environment was implemented via adding a shock to round earnings of +/- 5 of which was framed to participants in various ways. They conclude to this increased cooperation being brought on by superstition and solidarity. We take this additive shock idea to other standard experimental economic games that have developed literatures, trends, and results, and test the robustness of their finding. For our purpose, we are most concerned with games that have some inherent trade-off between the group-interest and self-interest. With this conditions in mind, we opted for the finitely repeated versions with partner's treatment of the following games in their standard forms. Additionally, the framing of the shock will most likely be the explicity 50-50 framing or the ambiguous one. Group level shocks will most likely be utilized. Subjects are aware of their payoff, and the value of the occuring shock. We utilize between subject design for our experiment.

## Economic Games

Prisoner's Dilemma
- Baseline - standard choices. This is a binary choice public goods game with group size of two.
- Treatment - Add a +/- shock to payoffs after each decision is made.

Stag Hunt
- Baseline - standard choices. For this we are interested in the coordination aspect and if people are pushed to Stag, Stag in this environment. This also helps us address Chen and Zhong (2021) who claim that uncertainty motivates morality; however, there is no moral choice being made in the Stag Hunt so these results, if any from uncertainty, cannot be motivated by moral concerns.
-  Treatment - Add a +/- shock to payoffs after each decision is made.

Common Pool Resources
- Baseline - standard choices. Sort-of the inverse choice of a public goods game, involves rivalry component that PGG lacks.
- Treatment - Add a +/- shock to payoffs after each decision is made.

Although not found to be significant in their linear-VCM, we repeat Hajikhemeneh and Iannaccone's use of the Holt-Laury (2002) Risk Elicitation.

Following the Economic Game, and the Risk Elicitation, will be a Questionnaire of general demographic questions and Strategy Elicitation questions to try to better understand the decision-making process of subjects in our experiment.
