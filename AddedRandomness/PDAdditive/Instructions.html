<h3>Welcome</h3>

    <p>
        This experiment is a study of economic decision-making.  Everyone in this experiment is receiving the exact
        same instructions. You will earn $7 simply for participating in this experiment for its full duration. But if
        you follow the instructions and make careful decisions, you can earn a significant amount of additional money.
        You will be paid at the end of the experiment via PayPal. The entire amount of money which you
        earned with your decisions throughout this experiment will be added up and paid to you at the
        end of the entire experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the experiment your earnings will be measured in points. Each point is worth X cents, so at the end of
        the experiment your points will be converted to dollars at a rate of XX points per dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important that you remain silent and not look at other people's work during the experiment. If you talk,
        laugh, or exclaim out loud you will be asked to leave and will not be paid. If you have any questions or need
        assistance, raise your hand the experimenter will come to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Matching</h3>

    <p>
        In this experiment you will be paired with one other player. You will be <strong>randomly</strong> paired with
        this player, and you will not know the identity of the participant you are matched with. Because you are known
        only by your random ID number, there will be no way for anyone (including the experimenters) to know who you
        or your partner are matched with or what decisions you make.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Decision</h3>

    <p>
        Both you and the other player will have two possible choices. You can choose <strong>Left</strong> or you can
        choose <strong>Right</strong>. If you both choose <strong>Left</strong> you will both get a payoff of
        {{ C.payoff_both_cooperate }}. If you both choose <strong>Right</strong> you will both get a payoff of
        {{ C.payoff_both_defect }}. If you choose <strong>Right</strong> but the other player chooses <strong>Left</strong>,
        you will get a payoff of {{ C.payoff_cooperate_defect_high }}, but the other player will receive
        {{ C.payoff_cooperate_defect_low }}. Likewise, if you choose <strong>Left</strong> but the other player chooses
        <strong>Right</strong>, then you will receive {{ C.payoff_cooperate_defect_low }} and the other player receives
        {{ C.payoff_cooperate_defect_high }}. These payoffs are summarized in the table below. The first number in each
        box is the payment received by you, the second number is the payment received by the other player:

    </p>

    <p>
        When choosing your move, you will <u>not</u> know the choice of the other player. You must make your choice
        <i>without</i> knowing what the other player will choose. After all players in the experiment have made their choices,
        the computer will report to you the move chosen by the other player and your payoff from <i>this period</i> of play.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will play the one-period game just described to you for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} periods with the <strong>same</strong> other
        player.
    </p>

    <h3>Adjustment</h3>

    <p>
        After you and the other player's decisions are made, the computer will make adjustments to the earnings of all the participants
        in the experiment. The adjustments will be either +5 or -5 points. The same adjustment will be made to the
        earnings of the other member you are matched with, but the other matched individuals in this session
        may receive different adjustments. The computer will choose the adjustment for your group based on a random
        number calculation, so that there will be a 50% chance that {{ C.additive_shock_value }} are added to the
        earnings of you and the other player you are paired with and a 50% chance that {{ C.additive_shock_value }} are
        subtracted the earnings of you and the other player you are matched with. The computer will calculate a different
        random number for all matched pairings in this experiment.
    </p>

    <p><strong><i>Example</i></strong>: If you both choose <strong>Left</strong> and the computer randomly picks to add
        {{ C.additive_shock_value }} your period payoff will be {{ C.payoff_both_cooperate }} +
        {{ C.additive_shock_value }} = 17.
    </p>

    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>

    <p>
        Your identity in the experiment will not be made known to any other participant at any time in the experiment.
        <i>Your decisions and payoffs are confidential</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Do not discuss your choices or payoffs with any other player!</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Thank you and Good Luck!</strong>
