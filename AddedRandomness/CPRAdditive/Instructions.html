    <p>
        This experiment is a study of group and individual behavior. Everyone in this experiment is receiving the exact
        same instructions. You will earn $7 simply for participating in this experiment for its full duration. But if
        you follow the instructions and make careful decisions, you can earn a significant amount of additional money.
        You will be paid at the end of the experiment via PayPal. The entire amount of money which you
        earned with your decisions throughout this experiment will be added up and paid to you at the
        end of the entire experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the experiment your earnings will be measured in points. Each point is worth X cents, so at the end of
        the experiment your points will be converted to dollars at a rate of XX points per dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important that you remain silent and not look at other people's work during the experiment. If you talk,
        laugh, or exclaim out loud you will be asked to leave and will not be paid. If you have any questions or need
        assistance, raise your hand the experimenter will come to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Group</h3>

    <p>
    Each participant will be <strong>randomly</strong> assigned an ID number and randomly assigned to a four-person
    group. The group will remain the same throughout this portion of the experiment. There are 16 participants in today's
    experiment, so there will be 4 groups in all with 4 members in each. Because you are known only by your random ID
    number, there will be no way for anyone (including the experimenters) to know which group you are in or what
    decisions you make.
    </p>

    <h3> Your Decisions</h3>

    <p>
        This experiment consists of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} decision-making periods. At the start of each period you will receive
        {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. All other members of your group will also receive {{ C.ENDOWMENT}} each period.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each period you will have to decide how to divide your points between <i>two accounts</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Group's Joint Account</strong>: You are allowed to invest in your Group's Joint Account any whole
        number X between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} (inclusive).
    </p>

    <p>
        The payoffs you receive from your Group's Joint Account depends not only on the amount you invest in your
        Group's Joint Account, but also on the investment decisions of the other 3 members of your group.
        You will find the payoff formula for the Group's Joint Account below.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Personal Account</strong>: After investing in the Group's Joint Account, the remaining amount of your
        points will automatically be invested in your Personal Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        For your Personal Account, the payoffs you receive depend only on your investment decision. Every point you invest
        in your Personal Account gives you a payoff of 1 point. If you invest X points in your Group's Joint Account,
        you will invest ( {{ C.ENDOWMENT}} - X) points in your Personal Account, and this will give you a payoff of
        ( {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} - X) points from your Personal Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Adjustment</strong>: After you and the other player's decisions are made, the computer will make adjustments to the earnings of all the participants
        in the experiment. The adjustments will be either +5 or -5 points. The same adjustment will be made to the
        earnings of the other members you are matched with, but the other groups in this session
        may receive different adjustments. The computer will choose the adjustment for your group based on a random
        number calculation, so that there will be a 50% chance that {{ C.additive_shock_value }} are added to the
        earnings of you and the other players you are paired with and a 50% chance that {{ C.additive_shock_value }} are
        subtracted the earnings of you and the other player you are matched with. The computer will calculate a different
        random number for all matched groups in this experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Total payoffs</strong>: Your total payoffs <i>per period</i> are the sum of your payoffs from your
        Group's Joint Account +/- the adjustment to your Group's Joint Account, and your Personal Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following table describes your total payoffs (those of you interested in the payoff formula can find it below).
        <br>
        The second row in the table shows different investment levels in your Group's Joint Account that you can choose (X).
        The second column shows different <strong>sum of the investment</strong> in the Group's Joint Account that the
        other 3 members of your group may choose (Y). The remaining entries show the total payoffs you earn if you
        choose the row level investment X (where X is the amount you invest in the Group's Joint Account) and the sum
        of the investment of the others Y.
        <br>
        In other words, the entry corresponding to column Y and row X indicates your payoff in the case your investment
        into the Group's Joint Account is X and the sum of the investment of the others is Y.
    </p>

    <p>
        * Insert Table Here once parameters are selected *
    </p>

    <p>
        Your Total Payoffs = Your Group's Joint Account Payoffs + Adjustment Value + Your Personal Account Payoffs
        <br> = [ 6 - 0.0125*(Y+X)]*X +/- 5 + (100 - X)
    </p>

    <p>
        Where X is your investment decision in the Group's Joint Account and Y is the sum of the investments of the others
        in the Group's Joint Account.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Period by period information</strong>: You will not get information on the individual decisions of the
        other members of your group. In each period, after all participants have made their decisions you will get information
        on: (1) your own decision, (2) the sum of the decisions of others, (3) your payoffs in the Group's Joint Account,
        (4), your payoffs from your Personal Account, (5) the realized adjustment selected by the random algorithm,
        and (6) the sum of the payoffs in both accounts.
    </p>

        <strong>Please raise your hand if you have any remaining questions.</strong>

    <p>
        <strong>Thank you very much for your participation!</strong>
