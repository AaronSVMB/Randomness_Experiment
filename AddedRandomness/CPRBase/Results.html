        Period: {{ player.round_number }} / {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}
    </p>
    <p>
        You started this period with {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}, of which you invested {{ player.investment }} in your Group's
        Joint Account. The Group Account totaled an investment of {{ group.total_investment }}, resulting in earnings of
         {{ player.common_pool_earnings }} for you. You also invested {{ player.personal_account }} to your Personal
        Account which earned you {{ player.personal_account }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, by summing your Group's Joint Account earnings with your Personal Account earnings,
        your period total earnings are {{ player.payoff }}.
